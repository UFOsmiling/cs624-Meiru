# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

# Input

The program allows the user to enter their favorite MSCS course via a `TextInput` field. Additionally, the `icon.png` image is statically loaded from the `./assets` directory to be displayed at the top of the screen.

# Process

The application is a React Native functional component created using an arrow function. It uses the core components: `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `Image`, `TextInput`, and `StyleSheet`. The program processes the userâ€™s input in real-time with the `useState` hook and updates the UI dynamically. The course list is mapped from an array and displayed using multiple `Text` components inside a scrollable view.

# Output

The output is a neatly styled, scrollable screen that displays the universityâ€™s MSCS course list, the userâ€™s favorite course, and a logo image. The app visually responds as the user types their course of choice, showing immediate updates on screen. It provides a smooth and responsive UI for learning core React Native layout and input features.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
