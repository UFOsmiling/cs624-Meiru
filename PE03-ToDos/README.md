# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

# Input

The user interacts with a text input field to type a new todo item. After typing, the user presses the Add button, which captures the input value. Tapping on any existing todo toggles its completion status. The app also listens for tab selection to filter between all, completed, and incomplete todos.

# Process

When a user enters a new todo and presses the Add button, the app creates a new object with a unique ID, text, and a completed flag set to false. This new object is appended to the list of todos and displayed immediately. Internally, Reactâ€™s state management (useState) handles updating and rendering the list dynamically. The app uses a bottom tab navigator to allow switching views based on todo status.

# Output

The app displays a real-time list of todos, showing either all, completed, or incomplete tasks based on the active tab. New todos are printed to the console log for debugging purposes.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
