# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
# Input
There is no user input for this mobile application. The content is hard-coded in the React Native code. The program uses three text values: the student's name, their degree program (e.g., MSCS), and their school (City University of Seattle). These values are set directly within the `Text` components.

# Process
This program uses the React Native framework and is executed within the Expo development environment. When the application runs, it loads the `App.js` file. A single `View` component wraps three `Text` components. The app also uses a `StyleSheet` to control layout and appearance. The container view centers the text and sets the background to yellow, while the text is styled to have spacing and appropriate size. No conditional logic or data manipulation occurs in this program.

# Output
The output is a mobile screen displaying the userâ€™s name, degree program, and school name. All text is shown against a yellow background, centered both vertically and horizontally.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
